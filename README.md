# 1dArrayOutliner
1dArrayOutliner is a desktop wiki based on a linear address space. The user creates a personal knowledge base with alphanumeric IDs.

The goal is to program an outliner app with the python language. The GUI framework is wxpython. The user can see two panes on the window. The left pane shows a 1d array which contains the pagelist. The typical CRUD operations are implemented to create, retrieve, update and delete the pagelist.

The right window shows a WYSIWYG editor. For the beginning only text is displayed but no graphics. The problem is, that a graphic has to be converted first into the HTML syntax and then translated into the markdown syntax. This procedure is complicated to implement.

What the user can do with the prototype is to create some pages, create links to the pages and browse in the menu up and down. So the user can create his personal card index.
